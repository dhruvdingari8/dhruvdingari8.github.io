            Who are you?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am Dhruv. I am a Computer Engineering/Computer Science student at Northeastern University. I sometimes choose to go by Rosemi online :3

        <h2>
            Why did you make this website?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I was inspired by the websites of olde <i>(2010's)</i> and how personal they were.
            Personally, I'm kinda disgusted by the state of the internet in this era, with
            advertisements and corporate/impersonal branding everywhere. As sort of an escape
            from what the internet has become, I've decided to make this website my place to
            talk about whatever I want to :-D <br>
            I also wanted to have a place to write about some projects I've done as an engineer,
            so you can think of this website as my portfolio as well :3
